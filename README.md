This program runs in your system tray

it lets you add either youtube videos or youtube streams and lets you play the audio from said video/stream

Its mostly done now the only things I would add is the ability to delete items from the list without having to do it manually and adding support for playlists

ive uploaded the source code so feel free to contribute though you are gonna need ffmpeg and ffplay which you can just grab from the release zip file
